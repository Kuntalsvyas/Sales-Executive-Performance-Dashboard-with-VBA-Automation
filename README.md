## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end performance tracking system designed to evaluate Sales Executives across multiple regions. Moving beyond static reporting, I implemented **VBA/Macro automation** to standardize the data cleaning process and generate instant performance reports.
The tool provides management with a clear view of who is hitting targets, who is eligible for commissions, and where the sales bottlenecks are located.

## ⚙️ Automation & Macro Features
- **One-Click Data Cleaning:** Developed a Macro to automatically format raw data dumps, remove duplicates, and standardize date formats, saving approximately 30 minutes per reporting cycle.
- **Automated PDF Export:** (If applicable) A custom script that exports individual executive scorecards into PDF format for monthly reviews.
- **Dynamic Reset:** A Macro button to clear all filters and slicers, resetting the dashboard view for new analysis.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
- **VBA/Macros:** Automation of repetitive formatting and data preparation tasks.
- **Advanced Logic:** Used `SUMIFS`, `XLOOKUP`, and `IFERROR` to build a robust calculation engine.
- **Performance Math:** Created logic for **Achievement %** (Actual vs. Target) and tiered **Commission Calculations**.
- **Interactive UI:** Implementation of Slicers, Timelines, and Conditional Formatting (Heatmaps) to highlight underperformers.

## 📊 Key Business Metrics (KPIs)
- **Achievement Index:** Tracking the % of target met by each Sales Executive.
- **Incentive Calculation:** Dynamic calculation of bonuses based on tiered performance levels.
- **Managerial Overview:** High-level view of team performance grouped by Senior Managers.
- **Top/Bottom Performers:** Automated ranking of the top 5 and bottom 5 executives to assist in HR reviews.
